Simple Genetic Algorithm 

There are four proposed projects, each of which runs for 3 years and has the following characteristics.
 
The available budget is 3.1 million for year 1, 2.5 million for year 2 and 0.4 million for your 3. The problem is to decide which projects to invest in order to maximize the total return.  
You need to develop a genetic algorithm program in Java to solve this problem.
You also need to provide a write up explaining:
-	The encoding of the problem (given in the hints below)
-	The crossover mechanism used
-	The mutation used
-	The fit function used
-	The selection of each generation
-	The stopping criteria
